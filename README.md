The ML-Flask Crime Prediction Application

1. Description, Overview and Motivation

2. Technologies Used

In designing, programming and developing this application, several useful technological frameworks and algorithm builders were infused and work to provide several specific functionalities. The following is a list of all the technologies used and a short description of how they facilitated the overall success of the application.

•	Python

•	Flask ML – This is a framework that is written in Python, and is mainly used for web applications. I implemented this framework for my application to facilitate deployment of the Machine Learning models needed for the application and because of how fast and smartly one can develop using its implementation.

•	SQLite – SQLite is a relational database management system that does not require a server. I chose this DBMS for this project because of its ease of implementation and versatility. It is an in memory open source library that does not require installation and is highly convenient and manageable in size. 

•	HTML

•	CSS

•	JavaScript

3. Functional Requirements

The functional requirements for this crime predicting application system are outlined as follows:

•	Registration of users where new users are able to register as members using the application.

•	Signing in of users through a login page where they can enter the details provided in registration. 

•	Collection of data that is analyzed and the outcome produced. 

•	Pre-processing of collected data.

•	Modelling of the predictive outcome model.

•	Actual prediction of crime from the preprocessed dataset using the predictive ML model.

4. Non-Functional Requirements

The main non-functional requirements for this crime prediction application system are described below:

•	Usability Requirement – That the ML Flask Crime Prediction Application is designed and implemented with ease of use and includes a user friendly environment for all users it is intended for. 

•	Efficiency Requirement – That the ML Flask Crime Prediction Application is designed and developed to perform its functions through efficient methods and algorithms. 

•	Security Requirement – That the system ML Flask Crime Prediction Application will be secure at all times following all security protocols and ensure authentication and authorization measures are put in place throughout the system. 

•	Data Integrity Requirement – That the data used within the ML Flask Crime Prediction Application and all processes involved is maintained and assured of its accuracy and consistency all through its life cycle within the system. 

•	Manageability Requirement – That the ML Flask Crime Prediction Application is designed and developed in a way that system administrators can monitor the system with ease and efficiency even in the case of potential system failures. 

5. Software Design and Architecture

6. User Interface Description

The user interface for the application is easy to navigate through and provides adequate interactivity. The main features comprising the user interface include:

Registration Page

Upon launching the application new users are prompted to register as members within the application. Their required data that is username, e-mail and password is collected through a HTML form and recorded in the application’s database.

Login Page

All registered users are able to access the applications core functionalities through a login page. They are required to enter their username and password which is authenticated and verified from the database before they are allowed access. 

Dashboard/Main Page

The user interface also comprises of the main page or dashboard where users can upload a given dataset, select conditions from a variety of options and generate a possible prediction by the click of a button. 

7. Software Components

•	Imported Libraries – Several libraries were important in implementation of the application’s architecture. Imported libraries were relevant to data processing, visualization and prediction. 

•	Data Processing – This component of the system involves data preprocessing, cleaning and removal of null and unwanted values.

•	Visualization of Crime Against Existing Forms of Crime – This component of the system’s architecture involves the processed data undergoing the process of Visualization of crime against existing forms of crime. 

•	Model Generation – The data model is designed and created. 

•	Building of KNN Classifier – The KNN classifier is built and used for analysis and processing of the provided data.

•	Accuracy Comparison – The level of accuracy is compared among the different instances of classifiers used. 

8. Security and Reliability

The ML Flask Crime Prediction was designed and developed with issues of security being one of the main concerns because of the nature of its core functionality. To ensure security of the application, the following measures were executed; 

•	The latest version of Python was used to ensure no exploitation of inputs is possible. 

•	Setting up of virtual environments to prevent effects of malicious code from potential hackers or other sources. 

•	Setting of the debug to false when conducting live deployment of the application.

•	Use of legitimate and up to date data packages to prevent entry of packages with malicious code. 

•	All the necessary programming techniques were employed to protect the data in use against potential SQL injections.
