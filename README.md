<p align="center"><strong>The ML-Flask Crime Prediction Application</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Description, Overview and Motivation</strong></p>
<p>Ever since the beginning of civilization as we know it, one of the main issues in society has always been that of crime. Dealing with it and even preventing it before it happens has always been and will always be the endeavor in order to realize a peaceful and hospitable society. Different ways and means have been thought of and implemented to aid in eradicating the issue of crime. In modern times with the age of rapid technological advancements reigning supreme, more technologically advanced techniques have been invented. The desire to contribute in providing a solution as an innovative technology enthusiast was what motivated me and heightened my interest in designing and developing this application. The main objective of the ML-Flask crime prediction application therefore was to come up with an established method of algorithm that analyses a specific set of data which contains almost all the crimes that have been committed before in a particular area. The application then provides a prediction of the type of crime that will occur in that particular area basing on the crimes that have happened through the KNN algorithm.</p>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>5. Software Design and Architecture</strong></p>
<p>The system design and architecture is an important factor to consider when designing and developing any modern application or software system. The ML Flask Crime Prediction Application has a simplified and efficient design that to an efficient processes and accurate and reliable results. The architectural arrangement of the application is represented and illustrated comprehensively with the aid of the system specification(architecture) diagram in the document.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6. User Interface Description</strong></p>
<p>The user interface for the application is easy to navigate through and provides adequate interactivity. The main features comprising the user interface include:</p>
<p><strong>Registration Page</strong></p>
<p>Upon launching the application new users are prompted to register as members within the application. Their required data that is username, e-mail and password is collected through a HTML form and recorded in the application&rsquo;s database.</p>
<p><strong>Login Page</strong></p>
<p>All registered users are able to access the applications core functionalities through a login page. They are required to enter their username and password which is authenticated and verified from the database before they are allowed access.</p>
<p><strong>Dashboard/Main Page</strong></p>
<p>The user interface also comprises of the main page or dashboard where users can upload a given dataset, select conditions from a variety of options and generate a possible prediction by the click of a button.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>7. Software Components</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Imported Libraries &ndash; </strong>Several libraries were important in implementation of the application&rsquo;s architecture. Imported libraries were relevant to data processing, visualization and prediction.</li>
<li><strong>Data Processing </strong>&ndash; This component of the system involves data preprocessing, cleaning and removal of null and unwanted values.</li>
<li><strong>Visualization of Crime Against Existing Forms of Crime </strong>&ndash; This component of the system&rsquo;s architecture involves the processed data undergoing the process of Visualization of crime against existing forms of crime.</li>
<li><strong>Model Generation &ndash; </strong>The data model is designed and created.</li>
<li><strong>Building of KNN Classifier &ndash; </strong>The KNN classifier is built and used for analysis and processing of the provided data.</li>
<li><strong>Accuracy Comparison &ndash; </strong>The level of accuracy is compared among the different instances of classifiers used.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>8. Security and Reliability</strong></p>
<p>The ML Flask Crime Prediction was designed and developed with issues of security being one of the main concerns because of the nature of its core functionality. To ensure security of the application, the following measures were executed;</p>
<ul>
<li>The latest version of Python was used to ensure no exploitation of inputs is possible.</li>
<li>Setting up of virtual environments to prevent effects of malicious code from potential hackers or other sources.</li>
<li>Setting of the debug to false when conducting live deployment of the application.</li>
<li>Use of legitimate and up to date data packages to prevent entry of packages with malicious code.</li>
<li>All the necessary programming techniques were employed to protect the data in use against potential SQL injections.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>9. Application Testing</strong></p>
<p>In order to ascertain that this application performs all its functionalities correctly, a number of acceptance tests were done to for each requirement. All the requirements passed the designated tests to the required degree. This translated to depicting well managed implementations of all the functionalities within the system. In brief, the following table illustrates the process and outcome of some of the main tests done for the system.</p>

<p><strong>10. Results, Future Enhancements and Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>From what has been discussed in this paper, crime management is an important undertaking for any progressive society. It has been mentioned and statistically proven that the basic details obtained from the criminal activities that have occurred in a particular area can be used to predict criminal activities in the same area in future. Indicators from machine learning techniques can be employed to effectively classify criminal activities basing on a given set of criteria. The application being discussed in this paper managed to achieve the desired objective of predicting the types of crime that are likely to occur when provided with an existing crime dataset. The main problem encountered during the development of this application was with the training model. This problem originated from the imbalanced nature of the dataset categories. This problem was resolved through manipulating it to either lean towards oversampling or under sampling of the existing datasets for the implementation.</p>
<p>The ML Flask Crime Prediction application is also always open to improvement of course. Some missing features could be included in future implementations to enhance it even further and make it more efficient. One such is additional of both visual and intuitive criminal and intelligence investigation techniques to facilitate better analysis of crime patterns by the application. Application of more data mining techniques such as classification can also be incorporated to improve the results.</p>
<p>The results obtained from this project are reflective of the potential bright future that crime data mining has, or increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of criminal analysis. Undertaking this project has been a mind opener to new paradigms of programming and I have learnt how to implement more frameworks in design and development. I have also learnt new project management skills and techniques that will go a long way in improving the quality of future projects I undertake.</p>
